= Sample Task Application that demonstrates missing metrics from Prometheus.

In this sample the user wants to view the `spring_cloud_task_seconds_sum` metric in prometheus.
For some executions this value is not sent to the Prometheus instance, however this metric
can be seen in the PrometheusMeterRegistry scrape when the `@AfterTask` has executed.
The Scrape is printed at the end of execution just before the `pushAndClose()`.
